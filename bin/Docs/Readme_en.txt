Mem Reduct
==========

Mem Reduct is a small application that allows you to monitor and
clean your computer memory. Exempt system cache, modified, and
idle memory pages. As a result of the program, the memory usage
is reduced by ~ 25%.

Released under GNU General Public License v2 license.

The program used undocumented features of system (Native API) to clear the
memory that have emerged since Windows Vista, so some cleaning methods are
not available in earlier versions Windows.
